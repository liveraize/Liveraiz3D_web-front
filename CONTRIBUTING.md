# Contributing to NiiVue

> This document is heavily influenced by the [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) contribution guide.

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to NiiVue. If you are not a developer, perhaps you would like to help with the [documentation](https://github.com/niivue/niivue/tree/main/packages/docs)? 

If you are a developer, contributing to the NiiVue source code is straight-forward if you have experience with JavaScript or Typescript. Knowledge of WebGL2.0 is only required if you would like to contribute to shaders or other low-level graphics code.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#best-practices-for-faster-reviews) by the Kubernetes team (but skip step 0 and 1)
 - Fork the NiiVue [git repository](https://github.com/niivue/niivue).
 - Write the code for your feature, bug fix, documentation change, or test.
 - Ensure tests work (including new ones you created). Many NiiVue tests use snapshots generated by Playwright, so you may need to update snapshots if you change way something is rendered.
 - Create a Pull Request against the **main** branch of NiiVue.

## Feature suggestions

If you want to suggest a new feature for NiiVue (e.g., new integrations), please open an [Issue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue/issues) and use an appropriate label. We use GitHub issues to track everything, including new features, questions, bugs, and documentation improvements.
